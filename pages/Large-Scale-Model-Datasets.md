- ## ABCD(Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development)
	- Downloading the raw imaging data from ABCD can take days to weeks, depending on computational resources. Converting the imaging data from DICOM to NIfTI format can also take weeks. For a team of 3–4 investigators working to generate connectivity matrices, processing and QC can take upwards of 8–9 months.
